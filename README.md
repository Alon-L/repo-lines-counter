# Repo Lines Counter
This is a simple beginner Perl project to count the number of lines in a repository.
You can provide a list of file and directory names which will be ignored from the count.

### Usage Guide
See guide for installation [Installation](#Installation).

##### Files:

- **output.json**: Once you run the Perl script, a JSON file output will be generated in the root scope, named `output.json`.
That file contains the number of lines for every file and directory in the provided repository.

- **ignore.json**: This file contains the files and directories you wish to ignore while counting the number of lines in the repository. [The file structure](/ignore.json) 

The paths for both files can be changed in the constant variables named `OUTPUT_FILE_PATH`, `IGNORE_CONFIG_PATH` respectively.
