# Repo Lines Counter
This is a simple beginner Perl project to count the number of lines in a repository.
You can provide a list of file and directory names which will be ignored from the count.

### Usage Guide
See guide for installation [Installation](#Installation).

__Files:__

- **output.json**: Once you run the Perl script, a JSON file output will be generated in the root scope, named `output.json`.
That file contains the number of lines for every file and directory in the provided repository.

- **ignore.json**: This file contains the files and directories you wish to ignore while counting the number of lines in the repository.

The paths for both files can be changed in the constant variables named `OUTPUT_FILE_PATH`, `IGNORE_CONFIG_PATH` respectively.

### Installation
Run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/Alon-L/repo-lines-counter
cd repo-lines-counter
perl repo-lines-counter.pl <repository URL>
```
